Please also see the [_**Learning-log**_](./Learning-log.md) and the [_**Development-log**_](./development-log.md) to get a story of how I approached this, and how my practice/learning has progressed from doing this project.

## Time_Table_Sharing

practicing building a server in c# for a time table sharing web-app for Michelle and I to share timetables. This is to be a learning exercise outside of college programming. I'll try to log what I learned from this as I go along to see if it sticks better that way and if I'll retain lessons better. Be good to look back later on what incorrect assumptions I made and how my understanding has changed over time.
