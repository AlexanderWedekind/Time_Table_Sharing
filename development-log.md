Not really sure what I'm doing with this yet, but I think this will be a log of what I've done and am doing/planning.
A bit like a different version of commit messages, but with more information and details, for the benefit of looking back later.
Maybe together with the [_**Learning Log**_](./Learning-log.md) this will be usefull reference for future projects, and might be helpfull if I need to speak about what I did here in interviews.

Back to [_**README**_](./README.md).

Not sure yet how I'll layout this, but for now I'll add new entries to the top of the list to avoid people having to scroll for miles.
