Not really sure what I'm doing with this yet, but I think this will be a log of what I've done and am doing/planning.
A bit like a different version of commit messages, but with more information and details, for the benefit of looking back later.
Maybe together with the learning log this will be usefull reference for future projects, and might be helpfull is I need to speak about what I did here interviews.
Refer to this in the readme.

Not sure yet how I'll layout this, but for now I'll add new entries to the top of the list to avoid people having to scroll for miles.
